### Desktop App (alpha version)

#### About
- App was built by Kenneth Marut using [Processing 3](https://processing.org/). If you're interested in messing around with the code, Processing can be downloaded [here](https://processing.org/download/). Once downloaded, open "moon_germs_app.pde"
- This is still very much an alpha version. The basic functionality of the program works, but there are several bugs. Additionally, the "save" feature has not been implemented.
- For Mac .app file click [here](https://github.com/friedpies/moon-germs/tree/master/Desktop%20App/moon_germs_app/application.macosx), and .exe files for both Mac and Windows [32](https://github.com/friedpies/moon-germs/tree/master/Desktop%20App/moon_germs_app/application.windows32) & [64](https://github.com/friedpies/moon-germs/tree/master/Desktop%20App/moon_germs_app/application.windows64) bit
