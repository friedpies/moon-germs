## Moon Germs
#### A hand-held, battery powered digital synthesizer based on the Teensy 3.2 and Audio Shield by www.pjrc.com

### About the Device
A fun, pocket-sized synthesizer that uses IR proximity as its primary input. Using a combination of buttons and triggers, the device can produce several different waveforms and effects. An 8x8 LED matrix shows useful and colorful information while in use. I wanted to explore digital synthesis using the Teensy Audio shield and experiment with a unique way of interacting with a synthesizer. Currently finishing up Rev 1.0
